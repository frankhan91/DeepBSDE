# [Deep BSDE Solver](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718942115) in TensorFlow

## Quick Installation

For a quick installation, you can create a conda environment for Python using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Training

```
python main.py --config_path=configs/hjb_lq_d100.json
```

Command-line flags:

* `config_path`: Config path corresponding to the partial differential equation (PDE) to solve.
There are seven PDEs implemented so far. See [Problems](#problems) section below.
* `exp_name`: Name of numerical experiment, prefix of logging and output.
* `log_dir`: Directory to write logging and output array.


## Problems

`equation.py` and `config.py` now support the following problems:

Three examples in ref [1]:
* `HJBLQ`: Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation.
* `AllenCahn`: Allen-Cahn equation with a cubic nonlinearity.
* `PricingDefaultRisk`: Nonlinear Black-Scholes equation with default risk in consideration.


Four examples in ref [2]:
* `PricingDiffRate`: Nonlinear Black-Scholes equation for the pricing of European financial derivatives
with different interest rates for borrowing and lending.
* `BurgersType`: Multidimensional Burgers-type PDEs with explicit solution.
* `QuadraticGradient`: An example PDE with quadratically growing derivatives and an explicit solution.
* `ReactionDiffusion`: Time-dependent reaction-diffusion-type example PDE with oscillating explicit solutions.


New problems can be added very easily. Inherit the class `equation`
in `equation.py` and define the new problem. Note that the generator function
and terminal function should be TensorFlow operations while the sample function
can be python operation. A proper config is needed as well.


## Dependencies

The code is compatible with TensorFlow >=2.16 and Keras 3.

For those using older versions

* a version of the Deep BSDE solver that is compatible with TensorFlow 2.13 can be found in commit [`5af8c25`](https://github.com/frankhan91/DeepBSDE/commit/5af8c25).

* *a version of the Deep BSDE solver that is compatible with TensorFlow 1.12 and Python 2 can be found in commit [`9d4e332`](https://github.com/frankhan91/DeepBSDE/commit/9d4e3329613d7a2a1f389a0d4cc652e1c4606b86).
